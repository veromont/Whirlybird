Whirlybird -the game<br />
My friends and I liked playing Whirlybird from Google Play. The original game itself is similar to the more famous doodle jump, but the gameplay is different, it's more dynamic and i think controls feel better.<br />
My version includes following features🔥:<br />
 - power-ups💪
 - coins as ingame currency🪙
 - skins💅
 - both normal mod and hard mode, which is more rewarding, but way more difficult💀
 - local leaderboard for normal and hard mod🏆
 - 3 languages, you can choose Ukrainian, English or Spanish🌐

To play game click on this link:<br />

Download the archive, extract it where you want and launch whirlybird.exe.<br />
You can also look at screenshots in screenshots folder on github.
