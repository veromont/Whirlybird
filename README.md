Whirlybird -the game
My friends and I liked playing Whirlybird from Google Play. The original game itself is similar to the more famous doodle jump, but the gameplay is different, it's more dynamic and i think controls feel better.
My version includes following features🔥:
 - power-ups💪
 - coins as ingame currency🪙
 - skins💅
 - both normal mod and hard mode, which is more rewarding, but way more difficult💀
 - local leaderboard for normal and hard mod🏆

Download the archive, extract it where you want and launch whirlybird.exe.
